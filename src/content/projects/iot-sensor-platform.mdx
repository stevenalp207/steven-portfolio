## Technical Implementation

### Firmware Development
```cpp
// Example: Multi-sensor data collection
void collectSensorData() {
    data.temperature = dht.readTemperature();
    data.humidity = dht.readHumidity();
    data.pressure = bme.readPressure() / 100.0F;
    data.airQuality = mq135.getPPM();
    data.soilMoisture = analogRead(SOIL_PIN);
    publishToCloud(data);
}
```
