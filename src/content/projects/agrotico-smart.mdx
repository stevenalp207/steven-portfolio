# AgroTico Smart - Precision Agriculture Platform

## Project Overview

AgroTico Smart is an innovative precision agriculture platform developed to address the challenges faced by Costa Rican farmers. The system combines Internet of Things (IoT) technology with Artificial Intelligence to provide real-time soil and microclimate monitoring, enabling data-driven farming decisions.

## Role & Contributions

**Project Leader** - Led the complete development cycle from conception to implementation:

- Designed and implemented the IoT sensor network architecture
- Integrated multiple environmental sensors (soil moisture, temperature, humidity, pH)
- Developed AI algorithms for data analysis and agricultural recommendations
- Managed team coordination and project timeline
- Represented the project in national and international competitions

## Technologies Used

- **Hardware**: ESP32 microcontrollers, environmental sensors (DHT22, soil moisture, pH sensors)
- **Software**: Python for machine learning models, Arduino IDE for embedded programming
- **Platforms**: Cloud-based data storage and visualization dashboards
- **AI/ML**: TensorFlow for predictive analytics and decision support systems

## Key Features

1. **Real-Time Monitoring**: Continuous tracking of soil conditions and microclimate variables
2. **AI-Powered Analytics**: Machine learning algorithms analyze historical and current data
3. **Smart Recommendations**: Automated suggestions for irrigation, fertilization, and pest control
4. **User-Friendly Dashboard**: Web-based interface for farmers to access insights easily
5. **Scalable Design**: Modular architecture allows expansion to different crop types and regions

## Outcomes & Impact

### Competition Achievements

- **National Champion** - Samsung Solve for Tomorrow 2025, Costa Rica
- **Regional Champion** - Samsung Solve for Tomorrow 2025, Latin America
- **Finalist** - Samsung Solve for Tomorrow 2025 LATAM Finals

### Real-World Impact

- Demonstrated potential for 30% reduction in water usage through optimized irrigation
- Improved crop yield predictions through AI-powered analysis
- Provided accessible technology solution for small to medium-scale farmers
- Contributed to sustainable agriculture practices in Costa Rica

## Technical Challenges Overcome

- Integration of multiple sensor types with varying protocols
- Development of reliable outdoor IoT deployment in agricultural environments
- Implementation of power-efficient systems for remote field operation
- Creation of accurate predictive models with limited historical agricultural data
- Design of intuitive interfaces for users with varying technical backgrounds

## Future Development

The project continues to evolve with plans for:
- Integration of weather forecast APIs for enhanced predictions
- Mobile application development for on-the-go monitoring
- Expansion to additional crop types and agricultural scenarios
- Partnership opportunities with local farming cooperatives
