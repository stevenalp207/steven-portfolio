# Industrial Sensor Housing Enclosures

## Project Overview

Designed a collection of protective enclosures for various sensors used in industrial automation and robotics projects. These enclosures provide environmental protection while maintaining sensor functionality and ease of installation.

## Design Portfolio

### Temperature & Humidity Sensor Housing
- **Compatible Sensors**: DHT11, DHT22
- **Features**: Ventilated design for accurate readings, wall-mountable
- **Material**: PETG for improved temperature resistance
- **Dimensions**: 60mm x 45mm x 30mm

### Proximity Sensor Bracket
- **Compatible Sensors**: Ultrasonic (HC-SR04) and IR proximity sensors
- **Features**: Adjustable angle mounting, cable management channels
- **Material**: PLA with reinforced mounting points
- **Dimensions**: 80mm x 50mm x 25mm

### Multi-Sensor Control Box
- **Capacity**: Houses Arduino/ESP32 with up to 4 sensors
- **Features**: Snap-fit assembly, integrated cable routing, DIN rail mounting
- **Material**: ABS for electrical insulation
- **Dimensions**: 150mm x 100mm x 60mm

## Design Considerations

### Environmental Protection
- IP54-rated design for dust and splash resistance
- Ventilation slots positioned to prevent water ingress
- Rubber gasket channels for enhanced sealing

### Practical Installation
- Standard mounting hole patterns (M3, M4 screws)
- Cable entry points with strain relief
- Clear labeling surfaces for documentation

### Manufacturing Optimization
- Designed for FDM 3D printing without supports
- Modular components for easy assembly
- Minimal post-processing requirements

## Technical Achievements

- **Thermal Management**: Ventilation design maintains sensor accuracy within ±0.5°C
- **Durability**: Enclosures tested for 500+ installation/removal cycles
- **Standardization**: Created reusable templates for future sensor housings

## Applications

These enclosures have been used in:
- EcoTrack plant monitoring system
- Industrial automation training modules
- LESCO gesture recognition system hardware
- Robotics competition prototypes

## Skills Demonstrated

- Parametric modeling in Fusion 360
- Design for manufacturability (DfM)
- Understanding of IP rating requirements
- Material selection for specific applications
- Cable management and strain relief design
- Assembly design and tolerance analysis
