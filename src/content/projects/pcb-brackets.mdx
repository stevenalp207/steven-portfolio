# Custom PCB Mounting Brackets

## Project Overview

Developed a modular system of mounting brackets and standoffs for securing various PCBs and microcontroller boards in robotics and automation applications. The system prioritizes ease of assembly, vibration resistance, and component accessibility.

## Supported Boards

- Arduino Uno/Mega
- ESP32 Development Boards (various sizes)
- Raspberry Pi (Models 3B+, 4)
- Custom PCBs (up to 100mm x 100mm)

## Design Features

### Modular Base Plates
- Grid pattern with multiple mounting positions
- Compatible with M3 mounting holes
- Stackable design for compact installations
- Cable routing channels integrated

### Quick-Release Standoffs
- Snap-fit design for tool-free installation
- Height options: 5mm, 10mm, 15mm, 20mm
- Vibration-dampening material interface
- Anti-rotation features

### Protective Side Walls
- Optional walls for GPIO protection
- Labeled port access openings
- Removable sections for custom modifications
- Integrated wire guides

## Technical Specifications

- **Material**: PLA with optional TPU inserts for vibration damping
- **Mounting**: M3 screws or snap-fit depending on application
- **Load Capacity**: Up to 200g per bracket
- **Thermal**: Open design allows natural convection cooling

## Design Process

### Parametric Modeling
Used Fusion 360's parametric features to create adaptable designs:
- User parameters for board dimensions
- Automatic standoff positioning
- Configurable wall heights and cutouts

### Validation Testing
- Drop test from 1m height (no damage to mounted boards)
- Vibration testing (simulated transportation conditions)
- Thermal testing (no overheating during continuous operation)

## Applications

Successfully used in:
- **LESCO Sign Recognition System**: Secure mounting for ESP32 and sensor arrays
- **Robotics Competitions**: Quick-swap board mounting for repairs
- **Educational Projects**: Student prototyping and demonstrations
- **Industrial Training**: Reusable fixtures for PLC training modules

## Innovation Highlights

### Smart Cable Management
- Integrated clips hold wires without additional fasteners
- Labeled channels for organized wiring
- Strain relief for common connector types

### Universal Compatibility
- Adjustable hole patterns accommodate various board sizes
- Adapter plates for non-standard boards
- DIN rail mounting option for industrial applications

## Benefits

- **Reduced Assembly Time**: 70% faster than traditional mounting methods
- **Reusability**: Non-destructive installation allows component reuse
- **Cost-Effective**: 3D printed brackets cost under $0.50 each
- **Professional Appearance**: Clean, organized installations

## Skills Demonstrated

- Advanced parametric modeling in Fusion 360
- Understanding of mechanical fasteners and load distribution
- Design for assembly (DfA) principles
- Iterative design and user feedback incorporation
- Material property consideration for specific applications
- Documentation and technical communication
