# Robotic Arm Gripper Design

## Project Overview

This project involved designing a custom gripper mechanism for our robotics competition team. The gripper was specifically designed to handle various objects in an agricultural robotics challenge, requiring precision, reliability, and adaptability.

## Design Features

- **Servo-Actuated Mechanism**: Utilizes a servo motor for precise control of grip force
- **Adjustable Grip Width**: Can accommodate objects ranging from 20mm to 120mm in diameter
- **Lightweight Construction**: Optimized for 3D printing with PLA material
- **Integrated Sensor Mounts**: Includes mounting points for proximity and pressure sensors

## Technical Specifications

- **Material**: PLA (3D Printed)
- **Grip Force**: Up to 5N
- **Operating Voltage**: 5V
- **Servo Type**: SG90 Micro Servo
- **Total Weight**: 85g

## Design Process

The design was iteratively developed using Fusion 360, with multiple prototypes created to test and refine the mechanism. Key considerations included:

1. **Strength Analysis**: Ensured structural integrity under operating loads
2. **Motion Simulation**: Validated range of motion and collision detection
3. **Assembly Optimization**: Simplified assembly process for quick repairs during competition
4. **Print Optimization**: Minimized support material requirements

## Results

The gripper successfully performed during the WRO competition, demonstrating reliable object manipulation throughout the event. The design's modularity allowed for quick maintenance and adjustments between rounds.

## Skills Developed

- Advanced 3D modeling techniques in Fusion 360
- Mechanical assembly design
- Design for additive manufacturing (DfAM)
- Iterative prototyping and testing
- Integration of electronic components with mechanical systems
