# 🤟 LESCOT  
## LESCO Sign Language Recognition Glove

**LESCOT** is an assistive technology initiative developed by students from **Colegio Técnico Profesional Don Bosco** with the mission of **reducing communication barriers between deaf and hearing people in Costa Rica**.

The project focuses on the development of an **intelligent glove capable of recognizing Costa Rican Sign Language (LESCO)** through wearable sensors and machine learning, translating hand gestures into understandable digital output.

---

## 🎯 Project Mission

LESCOT aims to promote **inclusion, accessibility, and equal rights** by providing a technological solution that facilitates communication with the deaf community and supports the principles of **Costa Rican Law No. 9822**, which promotes equality and inclusion for people with disabilities.

> *“Inclusion means accepting the diversity around us.”*
